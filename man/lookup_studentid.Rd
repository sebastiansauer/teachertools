\description{
Look up a student id given the last name
}
\details{
Looks up the student id given a CSV file and a last name.
Beware that double names may exist and hence cause problems.
All students (rows) with the matching last name are returned.
Note that the ID is returned as a character of length one (if it's a number),
in order to retain leading zeros of the ID. Columns are parsed as characters.
To that end, zeros are padded to the left side.
